## Overview

- The inspiration of the game comes from the original children's game of the same name that we used to play when we were much younger. I decided to put it into code, cool right?

## My process

- I have never built something like this before, so it was all kind-of new to me. I started by just desinging the page with pure CSS, then came the hard part of writing the logic of the game in code(JavaScript)- it was insane, after debugging and debugging with the help of [Google](www.google.com), [Stackoverflow](www.stackoverflow.com)😅, [w3Schools](www.w3schools.com), [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and my lovely Twitter community💙. At first i did not have in mind that i was gonna make the game responsive for mobile/touchscreen devices, i later felt the need to optimise the code for mobile/touchscreen devices- this took me into another battle of the bugs😣 (at some point i fell like just abandoning the project and just push as a desktop-only thingy😅). I won the battle of the bugs and boom💥...here it is. Although i still have the urge to implement more features to the game.........be on the look-out👀

### Built with
